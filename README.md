# Another Weather App!

This application will find the current weather for a specific city and country combination by calling the [OpenWeatherMap API.](https://openweathermap.org/api)
This API is extremely useful as it provides real-time forecast data for any city/region. 

# Directions
I feel that this application is quite self-explanatory, but why not be a little informative...

You can enter a city name or postal code and choose the corresponding country from the drop down. 
The application will give you the current and high/low temperature, weather description, and and a sweet 'lil icon showing the current weather state. 

Choose between farenheight or celcius units. 



The application is built with AngularJS for the front-end, and Express and Node for the backend.
